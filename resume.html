PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
New Horizon Center                           									June 2021 - Present
AWS Solution Architect
•	Architected serverless solutions using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway in event-driven patterns to power scalable and secure serverless applications.
•	Implemented AWS Systems Manager management service capabilities to automatically collect software inventory, apply OS patches, and automate administration tasks and complex workflows across our environments. 
•	Leveraged different design principles for security in the cloud and implemented various AWS services to improve our security posture for Authentication, Authorization, Monitoring, Auditing, Encryption and Data path security.
•	Implemented and managed Ansible Tower to scale automation and handle complex deployments.
•	OpenShift Onboarding in Pricing Domain and drive to develop Ansible Playbooks and setup configurations and ensure that the applications are deployed successfully in OpenShift platform.
•	Set-up pipelines for nightly builds enabling, Build, Sonar, Security Scans, deploy, Smoke test and Performance test weekly regression suites for early detection of issues.
•	Development and Enhancements of the “Insights” (DevOps Metrics Tool) and present the solution to Modern delivery Leads.
•	Design release and change management automation through pipeline (including the approval process).
•	Build and managed a Jenkins open-source automation server to deploy Code Build. artifacts with Code Deploy and constructed a functioning CI / CD pipeline with these tools to automatically deploy application version changes from GitHub to our production environment. 
•	Developed terraform modules and CloudFormation templates to provision infrastructures in cloud.  
•	Designed, implemented, and managed all elements of the control plane and the worker nodes in a Kubernetes deployment, in addition to containerizing the applications that will run in the pods.
